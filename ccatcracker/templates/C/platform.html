                <p >
                        Platform dependent typically refers to applications that run under only one operating system in one series of computers (one operating environment); for example, Windows running on x86 hardware or Solaris running on SPARC hardware. Sometimes, it means the same as "hardware dependent" or "machine dependent" and refers to applications that run in only one hardware series with the operating system not being relevant.

                <p >
                        When we compile any program written in any high level language using the language compiler, then the compiler produces executable code (managed native code) specific to the native platform. Say for example, if we compile a C program on Windows+32bit platform then the executable code generated by the compiler would be for windows with 32bit platform only. The code generated for Windows+32bit platform would not execute on Linux+32 bit platform called platform dependency. 
                </p>
                <h3 style="color: green"> How 'C' Platform Dependant ? :</h3>
                <p>
                        C program is written and saved with the name “hello.c”. It is compiled on Windows+32bit platform. The language compiler compiles the source code and produces the executable code for windows+32bit. The build generated for Windows+32bit would be executed on any computer of similar platform but would not execute on another platform like Linux+32bit.

                        What should we do if we want to develop an application for different platforms? No other choice rather compiling the same program on different platforms and producing different builds for different platforms.
