            <h3 style="color:black">Importance Of CCEE Score  : </h3>
            <p >
                Hey guys I got lots of enquiries regarding CCEE exam , what this exam and how this exam matter for placement . <br>
                and how the companies to shortlist the people as per the CCEE score . <br>
                So I will give the all answers.  Please read all this instructions very very carefully .  <br>

                <br><br>
                1. If your CCEE score is greater than 60 percentage then you will get maximum amount of  placement calls . <br>
                2. Even if you have degree score is less than 60 percentage.Maximum Companies will shortlist you as CCEE score only. <br>
                3. Some of the companies will shortlist as per degree percentage and CCEE Score . <br>
                4. If you are the 2019 passout and CCEE score is above 60 percentage and your degree Alto above 60 percentage , <br>
                   then for the dac students they will get daily almost 4 to 5 calls in first month of the Placement. <br>
                5. Remember guys you have only 30 calls C-DAC will not allow  to seat in placement if you got 30 calls . <br>
                6. So you have to must to be placed within 30 call .  <br>
                7. Those students who cross 30 calls they will block for  campus program.  After that there is a local campus program <br>
                   in that program that students will gets allowed.  <br>
                8. Local campus is very very worst you will get very less amount of package almost like 2 to 3 LPA Maximum . <br>
                9. Try to gets placed in first month of the  campus placement then you will get almost minimum 5 lpa package . <br>
                10. No one will give you all these details guys So please be stay with us always follow our all programs you all guys will gets placed within a month . <br>

            <h3 style="color:black">Types of Campus In CDAC : </h3>
            <p >
               Campus is divided into three parts : <br>
               1. On Campus (First month of campus) <br>
               2. Off Campus (After On campus ) <br>
               3. Local Campus <br> <br>
               First on campus which is in the first month of the placement this will be around 1 month . <br>
               Second  off campu  which will start  after the first month of placement means after the on campus. This campus will be around 1.5 to 2 months . <br>
               and in this campus  package will start to decrease . <br>
               And the last one is local campus this campus will go until the next batch. <br>
               In the local campus you will get very very rare calls like in two three days one or two call that's it . <br>
               And  package is also very less . <br>
