                    because no one will give Tutorials on english because its impossible . <br> <br>
                    Yes , but i can tell you what type of questions exam will ask . <br> <br>
                    For English almost 10,15 questions in exam so think how important it is . <br> <br>
                    Passages are not too much difficult try to understand passage carefully and then only start to give answers . <br> <br>
                    Synonyms and Antonyms these are another 2 important topics of exam exam 100 % ask 5 to 8 questions on these topics .
                    if your vocabulaory is strong then only you can solve these questions . <br> <br>
                    Dont worry but try to learn new english words as much as possible . <br> <br>
